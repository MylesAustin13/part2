# Muskan Kapoor's Write-up for Myles lab

**General**
The code follows all instructions and the code is nicely written

**Main.cpp**
1. Great attempt to read in the file. It is exactly what the lab extension calls for.  
2. removeLeadingSpaces works and int countChar works.
3. When using examples, it correctly counts open and close braces and removes leadingSpace indents. 
4. The bad-code.cpp (readng in the file) properly formats

**Just a note**
This did not impact compiling at all but I included #include <cstdlib>. It was added and fixes the error that were noted in your funcs.cpp. But it was not at all major. Just a point. 

## There were no major erros as everything complied and executed properly. Solution was exactly what the lab asked for. Grea job, MYles!
